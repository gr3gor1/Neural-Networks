# 1st Assignment

<div align="justify"><h4>This project consists of two parts the first part has to do with the EEG Eye State dataset and the second part has to do with the Dry Bean dataset. This project examines the use of supervised learning.</h4></div>

<ul>
<li><div align="justify"><h4>In the first part we examine the use of dummy, GNB, kNN and logistic regression as classifiers on the labeled data of EEG Eye State dataset. Initially we observed their out-of-the-box outputs and then by using optimization methods found out the optimal classifier and the alterations that we had to apply.</h4></div></li>

<li><div align="justify"><h4>In the second part of this assignment we had to use SVM and MLP as classifiers on the labeled data of the Dry Beans dataset. Initially we observed their out-of-the-box effectiveness on classification. Then using the Ray library to find the optimum solution we decided on the best possible choice of model and alterations that had to be made in order to get good results.</h4></div></li>
