<div align="justify">This repository contains the assignments that were developed in order to successfully complete the Neural Networks course in ECE NTUA. The first assignment is about supervised learning. The second assignment was created in order to observe unsupervised learning approaches. The third and final project involved transformers in order to create an image captioning system using a tensorflow tutorial as baseline.</div>
